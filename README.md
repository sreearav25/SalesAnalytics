SalesAnalytics — Simple Overview



SalesAnalytics is an end-to-end project that helps analyse:



\- Sales  

\- Profit  

\- Salary expenses  

\- Tax impact  

\- Employee costs  

\- Revenue prediction using machine learning  



The project includes three interfaces:



\### \*\*1. CLI App (Terminal Program)\*\*  

Used for technical users who prefer typing commands.  

Runs KPIs, prints summaries, runs models.



\### \*\*2. Streamlit Dashboard (Web App)\*\*  

A user-friendly interface with:



\- Sliders for salary, tax, and expenses  

\- Charts for profit, revenue, salary trends  

\- Employee add/update/delete  

\- ML prediction visualisation  



No coding required — everything runs in the browser.



\### \*\*3. Jupyter Notebook (Analysis)\*\*  

Used to explore data, check charts, and experiment with the ML model.

\## 🧱 How the System Works



The system is designed so that:



\- \*\*All three interfaces\*\* (CLI, Streamlit, Notebook)  

&nbsp; use the \*\*same Python logic\*\* for calculations  

\- All data is stored in a \*\*SQLite database\*\* and \*\*CSV files\*\*  

\- This makes the system reusable and maintainable

\## ⭐ Key Features



\- Salary + tax + expense simulator  

\- Complete employee management (CRUD)  

\- Monthly financial KPIs  

\- Machine-learning revenue prediction  

\- Profit after tax calculations  

\- Interactive charts and tables  

\- Jupyter notebook exploration

\### Salary, Tax \& Expense Simulator



Interactive sliders to simulate:

\- Base salary changes

\- Corporate tax rate

\- Other operating expenses



and see the impact on profit before/after tax.

# SalesAnalyticsVS



\- \*\*Python\*\* – core language

\- \*\*Streamlit\*\* – interactive dashboard (salary, tax \& expense simulator, charts, employee management)

\- \*\*Jupyter Notebook\*\* – exploratory analysis and model development

\- \*\*SQLite\*\* – persistent storage for employees and financials

\- \*\*Pandas, scikit-learn\*\* – data handling and machine learning



\## 🎓 Learning Context (Code Cumbria)



This project was developed as part of a 3-month learning journey with \*\*Code Cumbria\*\*, where I:



\- Learned how to build CLI apps for analytics and automation

\- Designed a full \*\*Streamlit dashboard\*\* for business users

\- Used \*\*Jupyter Notebook\*\* for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping

\- Integrated \*\*SQLite\*\* for real CRUD operations (employees + financials)

\- Combined my previous software development experience with new data and ML tools
